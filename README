Lyrical Page is a website development app for the Django framework.
Documentation is fairly nonexistant at this point. Please send any
questions to wlashell@lyrical.net or post a bug on github.

Installation is fairly small, you add site_content to your 
INSTALLED_APPS tuple, and include the SitePageFallback middleware
in your MIDDLEWARE tuple.
